Shortest-Splitline is a Python implementation of the shortest splitline 
algorithm, which can be used for drawing voting districts.

First, I am attempting a 1-D implementation, to be followed by a 2-D 
implementation, and one day maybe a 3-D implementation just to see how the
algorithm scales.

This project is inspired by the following articles:
